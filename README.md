# Patatap-Clone

## Synopsis

A Patatap clone I built using HTML5, JavaScript, the Howler.js library and Paper.js library

## Motivation

To learn more about and grow my skills in frontend development. As well as provide
a fun way to learn about the capabilites of different JS libraries, and apply them.

## Installation

Clone or download to your local machine and run circles.html

If you want to get rid of the Cross Origin errors in the console, you'll need to run a local HTTP server from your project's directory and load the circles.html file from there. The steps are as follows:

1) navigate to your project folder in the terminal

2) run: 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
3) open up your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

4) select the circles.html file
